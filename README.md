Our research endeavor involves the 
determination of the optimal machine learning model that 
yields the highest accuracy in segregating undesired messages 
or emails. The procedure for text classification was executed 
through the utilization of PySpark, employing a variety of 
machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support 
Vector Machine, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The 
dataset used for the experiments was sourced from Kaggle, a 
publicly accessible repository. In order to rectify data 
imbalance, Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 
(SMOTE) was employed to ensure an equal representation of 
both spam and ham instances. The outcome of our study 
prominently designates the support vector machine (SVM) as 
the most precise machine learning model, demonstrating an F1 
score of 97.93 and an accuracy score of 97.9.
